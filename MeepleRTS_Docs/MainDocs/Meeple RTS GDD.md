RTS made with controller in-mind.

## Overall Gameplay
Could be a fight to the death. Or a survive till the last or as a group. Not sure. Just a fun theme and fun genre that's not explored too much.

IMPORTANT IDEAS: 
Coming up with a unique game mechanics to the game that this genre does not have.
Does it have some sort of player card based system?
How to create a fun end-game that builds up hype? A lot of RTS genre I think is missing end game hype maybe.

IDEA: 
CONGRESS (Maybe DLC or part of Story mode)
In the world where The Mighty Dice is the core that keeps everything alive, every so often, all the leaders in the game are forced into a diplomatic room where everyone will have to vote on what they'll have to sacrifice to The Mighty Dice to stop The Mighty Dice from rolling.
If they vote to sacrifice nothing, a Dice Event will occur which will alter the game/world.
During this time, the time in the game will paused and all players will put in a pocket dimension. The players will be given X amount of time before they get brought back into the over world.

Question: 
Game should make sure to cater for single player. How would congress work in a single player game? It would be other nations. Maybe in single player, you don't actually get to see the other nations in the over world so that it's not necessary to create full AI nations that has a fully working city.

Maybe this one is a bit complicated. But it might be cool.
