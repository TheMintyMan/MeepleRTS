Go Back to [[Meeple RTS GDD]]

Fog of war

Everything in the map will be build with the mindset for allowing implementation of map generation in the future. Meaning all environment asset will fit in a grid format?
Question: How did Oskar Stahlberg make the townscaper 3D models to fit in like a wonky non traditional grid? Kind of cool that it breaks up the griddyness a bit.

FUTURE:
Random map generation using something like wave function collapse. And allows users to use seeds just like how Tooth and Tail creates their maps.
